Cut the Rope, version Eliza & Laura

In our new and improved version of Cut the Rope, you will find our continued alien star, OmNom, with the same goal of eating the candy. This time, he is on a journey from Jupiter to find more candy. However, OmNom will face new challenges to try and eat the candy that you, the user, must help him overcome. 


Level 1: the introduction
You will be introduced to the basics of our version of Cut the Rope. 
Available buttons: 
 - restart: restart the level, the length of the pendulum, and the gravity
 - length: change the length of the pendulum, within a range of 50 to 300 meters (represented in pixels)
 - gravity: change the acceleration due to gravity that the candy experiences within a range of 1 to 25 m^2/s


Cut the candy off the pendulum using [space]. You will be able to observe the velocity at which the candy will reach OmNom's mouth on the upper right corner. 


Level 2: the game
In the second level, you will be able to play Cut the Rope with a variety of functions you can change. The candy is obstructed by a frictionless platform and a ramp with friction, so you won't be able to directly drop the candy into OmNom's mouth. OmNom is now also subject to bodily constraints, so if the candy is too big or enters their mouth too quickly, then OmNom will choke. 
Available buttons: 
 - restart: restart the level, the length of the pendulum, and the gravity
 - length: change the length of the pendulum, within a range of 50 to 200 meters (represented in pixels)
 - gravity: change the acceleration due to gravity that the candy experiences within a range of 1 to 25 m^2/s
 - angle: change the angle of the ramp
 - mass: change the mass of the candy, and therefore the size, assuming the candy has the same density regardless of size
 - friction switch: choose whether or not you want friction on the ramp. Friction on the ramp will lead to the candy rolling.

Good luck helping OmNom get their candy!
