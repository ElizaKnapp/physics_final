Cut the Rope, version Eliza & Laura

In our new and improved version of Cut the Rope, you will find our continued alien star, OmNom, with the same goal of eating the candy. This time, he is on a journey from Jupiter on their rocketship to find more candy. However, OmNom will face new challenges to try and eat the already available candy that you, the user, must help him overcome. 



Level 1: the introduction

You will be introduced to the basics of our version of Cut the Rope. 

Available buttons: 
 - restart: restart the level, the length of the pendulum, the gravity, and the starting angle of the pendulum
 - length: change the length of the pendulum, within a range of 50 to 300 meters (represented in pixels)
 - gravity: change the acceleration due to gravity that the candy experiences within a range of 1 to 24 m/s^2
 - pendulum angle: change the starting angle of the pendulum from somewhere between 1 and 90 degrees


Cut the candy off the pendulum using [space]. You will be able to observe the velocity at which the candy reaches OmNom's mouth on the upper right-hand corner. 


Level 2: the game

In the second level, you will be able to play Cut the Rope with a variety of functions you can change. The candy is obstructed by a frictionless platform and a ramp with friction, so you won't be able to directly drop the candy into OmNom's mouth. OmNom is now also subject to bodily constraints, so if the candy is too big or enters their mouth too quickly, then OmNom will choke. 

Available buttons: 
 - restart: restart the level, the length of the pendulum, the gravity, the starting angle of the pendulum, the ramp angle, the mass of the candy, and the friction switch
 - length: change the length of the pendulum, within a range of 50 to 200 meters (represented in pixels)
 - gravity: change the acceleration due to gravity that the candy experiences within a range of 1 to 24 m/s^2
 - pendulum angle: change the starting angle of the pendulum from somewhere between 1 and 90 degrees
 - ramp angle: change the angle of the ramp between 10 and 70 degrees
 - mass: change the mass of the candy from 10 to 300 kgs, and therefore the size of the candy (assuming the candy's density is not dependent on size)
 - friction switch: choose whether or not you want friction on the ramp. Friction on the ramp will lead to the candy rolling while no friction on the ramp will lead to the candy sliding down the ramp. 


Cut the candy off the rope using [space]. You will be able to observe the velocity at which the candy will reach OmNom's mouth and the velocity at which OmNom will choke on the upper right corner. If the mass gets big enough, the velocity at which OmNom will choke decreases signficantly, so be careful! (specifically, once the mass is greater than 200 kgs, choking velocity goes down from 600 m/s to 400 m/s)


Have fun and good luck helping OmNom get their candy (OmNom will greatly appreciate your help, or be very sad that they don't recieve it)!
