Cut the Rope, version Eliza & Laura

In our new and improved version of Cut the Rope, you will find our continued alien star, OmNom, with the same goal of eating the candy. This time, he is on a journey from Jupiterto find more candy. However, OmNom will face new challenges to try and eat the candy that you, the user, must help him overcome. 

In the first level, you will be introduced to the basics of how Cut the Rope works. You have to get the candy to OmNom by cutting candy off the pendulum using [space]. You will also be able to change the length of the pendulum and the gravity on the candy. You will be able to see the velocity at which the candy reaches OmNom's mouth on the upper right corner. 

In the second level, the candy will be obstructed from reaching OmNom through a frictionless platform and a ramp with friction. This time, OmNom may also choke on the candy if it enters his mouth too quickly or the candy is too big for OmNom to eat all at once. To change the velocity, you will be able to cut the pendulum at different times, change the length of the pendulum, change the gravity, change the angle of the ramp, and change whether or not the ramp has friction. 

Good luck helping OmNom get their candy!
